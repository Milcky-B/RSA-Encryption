This project is a Python-based RSA encryption and decryption tool that provides a user-friendly graphical interface using Tkinter. It allows users to securely encrypt and decrypt messages using the RSA algorithm, a widely used public-key cryptosystem. The tool generates public and private keys, enables users to input plaintext or ciphertext, and displays the encrypted or decrypted results in real-time. Designed for simplicity and ease of use, this application is ideal for learning about cryptography, securing sensitive information, or integrating encryption into other projects.
